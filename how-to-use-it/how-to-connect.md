# Connecting to the Block

It may take 5 - 10 minutes on the first boot for the Block to load. Soon you will see a new Wi-Fi hotspot available to your phones, tablets and laptops called ‘Learner's-Block’. You guessed it, that’s the one you want. There will not be any password required.

Once you are connected to the Block, open your web browser and enter:

```
 http://lb.local
```

That’s it! You will now see the Learner’s Block welcome page and all of the default features available to the users.&#x20;
