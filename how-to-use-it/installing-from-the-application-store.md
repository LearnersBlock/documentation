# Installing from the Application Store

Your Learner's Block has an Applicaiton Store allowing on-click installation of popular EdTech platforms. 

In order to install from the Application Store, you will need:

1. Internet connectivity via [Wi-Fi ](connecting-to-a-wi-fi-network-optional.md)or [Ethernet](advanced-features/using-an-ethernet-connection.md)
2. Sufficient [space](../how-to-build-one/quickstart/picking-a-micro-sd-card-and-sd-card-reader.md#microsd-card) on your device for the downloaded application

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to know the space required for each application you can find the source containers on [GitHub](https://github.com/LearnersBlock/app-store), although it is unlikely you will encounter issues as the applications are optimised for space saving. 
{% endhint %}

## **Update an Application**

To check for available updates, press the refresh button.

If updates are availble, the button will change to indicate 'Update Available'. Click the button and the update will begin.

Updates follow the update procedure of the application provider. This means that if the application provided allows for updates without losing your settings and files then the same will be true for your update on the Learner's Block. 

## **Using an Application**

After installing an application, it will be available to all users via the frontpage of your Learner's Block. Click the application you want to use to begin:

If you want the installed application to be the first thing people see when they access your Block you can [change the default loading page](advanced-features/changing-the-default-loading-page.md).
