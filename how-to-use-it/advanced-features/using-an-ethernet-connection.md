  Connecting with an ethernet cable avoids relying on the Wi-Fi chip in your
  Block, and will significantly increase the number of simultaneous users that
  can use the Block.

# Using an ethernet connection

Some of the available hardware for running your Learner's Block has an _ethernet port_. This means you can use an Ethernet cable to connect your Block directly into a router in your home, office or school. Once plugged in:

1. Give your Block a minute to register on the new network
2. Connect your phone, tablet laptop or other device to the same router, either via Wi-Fi or ethernet cable
3. Visit your Learner's Block just like before, using [the URL](../how-to-connect.md) in your browser

{% hint style="warning" %}
When connected to your Block via a shared Wi-Fi router, you will not be able to access the Wi-Fi connect page used to connect your Block to Wi-Fi networks. Instead, connect directly to your Blocks own Wi-Fi hotspot as outlined in the [How to connect](../how-to-connect.md) guide, and then access the Wi-Fi Connect page.
