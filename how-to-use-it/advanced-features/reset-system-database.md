# Reset System Database

If you encounter database corruption due to SD card errors or software issues, you can reset the database to restore the original settings of your device.

Click the settings icon in the top right of the interface![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-03-23-at-13.23.52%20%281%29.png). Click the 'Advanced' tab.

Scroll to the bottom and you will find a `Reset` button under the 'System Maintenance' heading.

Resetting the database should only be done as a last resort as you will lose your configuration and it cannot be restored.
