# How we are funded

We are operated by the community, for the community, and therefore also funded by the community. 

This is why we are part of the Open Collective initiative, a new way to operate community led initiatives. Anyone can donate, big or small, individual or organisation. Everything spent and raised is listed on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/learnersblock/) page, meaning total transparency. 

The video below from the Open Collective explains more:
