# Picking hardware

We support a number of different hardware platforms, ranging in power and price to suit your needs. They are ordered here starting with the cheapest through to the most expensive:

* [Raspberry Pi Zero 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)
* [Orange Pi Zero LTS 512MB](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizerolts/)
* [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)

{% hint style="info" %}
We provide a [Raspberry Pi 3 image](https://downloads.learnersblock.org) for those who already have the hardware. We do not recommend buying a Pi 3 however, but to instead buy the Pi 4 due to its improved features at around the same cost, which is why the Pi 3 is not included in this documentation.

While there are lots to distinguish between the hardware, here is an overview of what we deem to be particularly noteworthy:

| [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 512MB](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)   | Unable to use 5GHz networks | Equivalent to the Raspberry Pi 3. Suitable for those on a budget and looking for a small device.                                              | Incredibly low cost, for those really needing to cut costs                                                                   | Good distribution, but limited in the quantities you can order at once | Provides the bare minimum needed to run the Block, no USB ports and no Ethernet                                                                                                                                                                          | Tried and tested, produced by a reliable manufacturer | Built in Wi-Fi, but with no aerial impacts the range                                                                                                                                                     | SD Card | $15USD                             |
| [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) |                             | A powerful system which is a significant step up from the others. Provides a good basis for running multiple applications from the App Store. | A step up from the Orange Pi Zero LTS may feel worth the splurge, but will begin to add up if buying a large number of units | Good distribution, but limited in the quantities you can order at once | Quad-Core processor, 2GB of RAM (no need to go higher) and a Gigabit Ethernet port means this hardware could be plugged into a school network to handle larger numbers. it does mean a larger form factor that won't fit in your pocket like the others. | Tried and tested, produced by a reliable manufacturer | No aerial, but the newer hardware and technologies provide a good range. Ethernet connectivity will allow for more users, but Wi-Fi is unlikely to support more users than the Orange Pi Zero LTS 512MB. | SD Card | $30USD                             |

{% hint style="warning" %}
While 512mb of memory is sufficient to run the Learner's Block platform, if you are planning to run several applications or demanding applications it would be better to opt for devices with 1gb of more.&#x20;
