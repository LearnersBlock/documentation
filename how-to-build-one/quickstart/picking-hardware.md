# Picking hardware

We support a number of different hardware platforms, ranging in power and price to suit your needs. They are ordered here starting with the cheapest through to the most expensive:

* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
* [Orange Pi Zero LTS 512MB](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizerolts/)
* [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
* [Balena Fin](https://www.balena.io/fin/?)

We also provide a [Raspberry Pi 2 image](https://downloads.learnersblock.org) and [Raspberry Pi 3 image](https://downloads.learnersblock.org) for those who already have the hardware. We do not recommend buying a Pi 2 or 3 however, but to instead buy the Pi 4 due to its improved features at around the same cost, which is why the Pi 2 and 3 are not included in this documentation.

While there are lots to distinguish between the hardware, here is an overview of what we deem to be particularly noteworthy:

|  | Power | Value | Availability | Features | Durability | Wi-Fi | Storage | Approximate cost \(before shipping\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) | Dated hardware, which no longer provides much bang for your buck. | Incredibly low cost, for those really needing to cut costs | Good distribution, but limited in the quantities you can order at once | Provides the bare minimum needed to run the Block | Tried and tested, produced by a reliable manufacturer | Built in Wi-Fi, but with no aerial impacts the range | SD Card | $10USD |
| [Orange Pi Zero LTS 512MB](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizerolts/) | Its Quad-Core processer makes this a significant improvement over the Raspberry Pi Zero W | Excellent value for money, although more per unit that the Raspberry Pi Zero | Shipping from China means this may take longer to arrive. But it will post to a wide range of countries making the availability good. | An Ethernet Port and USB Port make this feature rich hardware expanding the possibilities for your Learner's Block | Runs a little hotter than other units, that may result in slowdowns if in extreme heats and direct sunlight. | An included aerial gives the range a healthy boost | SD Card | $17USD |
| [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) | A powerful system which is a significant step up from the others. Unlikely to really benefit from all of its power, but does provide future proofing and a snappier response. | A step up from the Orange Pi Zero LTS may feel worth the splurge, but will begin to add up if buying a large number of units | Good distribution, but limited in the quantities you can order at once | Quad-Core processor, 2GB of RAM \(no need to go higher\) and a Gigabit Ethernet port means this hardware could be plugged into a school network to handle larger numbers. it does mean a larger form factor that won't fit in your pocket like the others. | Tried and tested, produced by a reliable manufacturer | No aerial, but the newer hardware and technologies provide a good range. Ethernet connectivity will allow for more users, but Wi-Fi is unlikely to support more users than the Orange Pi Zero LTS 512MB. | SD Card | $30USD |
| [Balena Fin](https://www.balena.io/fin/?) | An industrial powerhouse, designed for professional use in high-end manufacturer. Very few will benefit from this sort of power. | Unlikely that the majority of users will need what this offers. | Supports large orders, but distribution overseas more limited that the others as units will often come from the US. | Ethernet and USB Ports | Among the best in class | Designed for Internet of Things devices, Wi-Fi connectivity is central to its design | Built in 8/16/32/64 GB options. | $200USD+ \(will require additional hardware on top of this cost\) |

A little indecisive? Our personal choice is the Orange Pi Zero LTS 512MB, for its well-rounded features and power for a relatively low cost.
