# Security & Privacy

Learner's Blocks are designed to be used offline, which reduces security risks significantly. Yet we still build towards making them secure enough to be used in other more public environments just to be sure. All of the code running on the devices is available on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/LearnersBlock) for your own review. 

We use [Balena Cloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud) to provide device updates and device management services. Therefore, by using a Learner's Block you are also a user of Balena Cloud. Subsequently, the Balena Cloud privacy policy applies: [https://www.balena.io/privacy-policy/](https://www.balena.io/privacy-policy/). 

More information on security steps provided by Balena can be found here: [https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/welcome/security/](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/welcome/security/)
